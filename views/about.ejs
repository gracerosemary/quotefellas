            <p>My name is Grace Choi and I live in Seattle, Washington! I was born in New York, but consider Columbus, Ohio home. Having lived in 8 states and more than 20 cities, I always have an urge to travel. I love listening to music and going to live shows and festivals (pre-covid!). I also love hiking and exploring nature! Nowadays, I spend my time working and coding at home. 
              My first introduction to the study of computer tech was as a Freshmen in college. I took an Intro to Computer Science and the class consisted of learning binary numbers and how computers read them. I was quickly turned off and ended up dropping the class. After moving to Seattle, I wanted to explore different career paths. After joining Zillow, I realized coding was not what I thought it was. There were so many languages and processes that I never dreamed of. After taking a few HTML and CSS courses online, I realized that web development is so interesting and it quickly drew me in. I hope to become a Software Development Engineer and use my skills to offer web development assistance to enhance, not only my personal life, but for my family, friends, and community.

            <p>I'm a former Air Force munitions tech, turned bike mechanic, turned bike shop manager, turned full stack developer. I love to tinker and find creative ways to solve problems nobody knew they had. I'm constantly thinking of a better way to do something, or some goofy product. I'm steering my unique experiences into an innovative career in tech, focused on equity, and community.
